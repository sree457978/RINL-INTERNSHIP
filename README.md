A machine learning model has been developed to forecast the optimal combination of raw materials to enhance blast furnace efficiency.
This project focuses on predicting the CO and CO2 ratios in an industrial process based on various input variables. The dataset used for analysis and model development contains information such as flow rates, temperatures, pressures, and other relevant factors.
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the CO and CO2 ratios after specific time intervals.
The project starts with exploratory data analysis, where the dataset is examined to identify patterns, relationships, and any potential data preprocessing requirements.
Missing values in the dataset are handled by imputing them with median values. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to develop and evaluate the predictive model.
A Random Forest Regressor algorithm is chosen for model development due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and capture complex interactions between
variables. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and accuracy.
